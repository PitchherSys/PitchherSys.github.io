          Hello! My name is The Prince of Life, I'm a 14yo male with a passion for coding, OS development, and cybersecurity. (I'm an amateur in all three, though.)
          <br><br>
          My main focus is Windows tweaking and small amounts of backend development. I spend many of my days researching new ways to improve Windows.
          <p>I am very proficient in the batch coding language, I am currently learning PowerShell and soon will go on to C++ (or HolyC, lol.)</p>
          I really enjoy learning new things relating to computers and coding, and I want to know as much as possible. If you're more experienced than me, please reach out! I'd love to talk.
          <br><br>
          My other hobbies include gaming, listening to music, and talking to friends.
          <p>Though, I don't really play games much anymore.</p>
          I enjoy listening to metal music, particularly death metal, but also other subgenres like techdeath, deathcore, and deathgrind.
          <br><br>
          I also somewhat enjoy reading. From an early age I've been well ahead of my peers, and in 2024 tested above a college level in reading comprehension.
          <br><br>
          I LOVE the late 2000's and early 2010's, as well as the Frutiger Aero/Aurora aesthetic (if you couldn't tell, lol.)
          <br><br>
          I live in the CST timezone... It's <span id="time"></span> for me!
        </p>

        <script>
          // Live clock
          function updateTime() {
            const now = new Date();
            const opts = { timeZone: "America/Chicago", hour: "2-digit", minute: "2-digit", second: "2-digit", hour12: true };
            document.getElementById("time").textContent = new Intl.DateTimeFormat([], opts).format(now);
          }
          setInterval(updateTime, 1000);
          updateTime();
